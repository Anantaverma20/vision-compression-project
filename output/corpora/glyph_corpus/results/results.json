    "question": "What methodology was used?",
    "answer": "The methodology used is a paradigm called Glyph, which scales long-context text understanding through visual compression (doc_id p.3). Instead of extending token-based context windows like conventional LLMs, Glyph transforms ultra-long text inputs into compact visual images and processes them with a vision-language model (VLM) (doc_id p.3).\n\nThe Glyph methodology consists of three main stages (doc_id p.2):\n\n1.  **Continual Pre-training**: In this stage, large-scale long-context text is rendered into diverse visual forms (doc_id p.2). This enables the VLM to transfer its long-context capability from text tokens to visual tokens (doc_id p.2).\n2.  **LLM-driven Rendering Search**: An LLM-driven genetic search is used to automatically explore rendering parameters such as font size, layout, and resolution (doc_id p.2). The goal is to find the optimal configuration that maximizes compression while preserving the model's long-context ability (doc_id p.2).\n3.  **Post-training**: The configuration from the rendering search is applied in this stage (doc_id p.2). The model undergoes supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to further improve its performance on the visualized input (doc_id p.2). An auxiliary Optical Character Recognition (OCR) task is also applied to enhance the model (doc_id p.2).",
