Multiple resolution support\\n\\nSuppose we have an image with 1000 optical characters and we want to test how many vision tokens are needed for decoding. This requires the model to support a variable number of vision tokens. That is to say the DeepEncoder needs to support multiple resolutions.\\n\\nWe meet the requirement aforementioned through dynamic interpolation of positional encodings, and design several resolution modes for simultaneous model training to achieve the capability of a single DeepSeek-OCR model supporting multiple resolutions. As shown in Figure 4, DeepEncoder mainly supports two major input modes: native resolution and dynamic resolution. Each of them contains multiple sub-modes.\\n\\nNative resolution supports four sub-modes: Tiny, Small, Base, and Large, with corresponding resolutions and token counts of 512×512 (64"
